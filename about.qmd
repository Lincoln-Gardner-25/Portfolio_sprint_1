## Background

I'm a Strategic Management student at BYU's Marriott School of Business with a passion for solving meaningful problems through technology and data-driven decision making. My journey has taken me from analyzing patient data at a spinal rehab clinic to leading digital marketing campaigns that generated $12,000 in additional revenue. I thrive at the intersection of strategy, technology, and human-centered design.

When I'm not exploring product ideas or diving into business analytics, you'll likely find me on the ballroom dance floor—I'm a member of BYU's Ballroom Touring Company and have competed nationally, winning 65+ awards and performing in front of 15,000+ people across four countries.
